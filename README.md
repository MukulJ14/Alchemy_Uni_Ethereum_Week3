We have build our very own Ethereum Block Explorer!

Special Thanks to @alchemy for the wonderful guide


Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:

* the blockchain network itself
* blocks in the blockchain
* transactions in a block
* accounts
 and many other things

Here we are displaying the following info using APIs on our React App:
* Block Number
* Gas Used
* Transaction Count
* All the Transactions

This is our own Ethereum Block Explorer using Alchemy SDK!!

Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:

 * the blockchain network itself
 * blocks in the blockchain
 * transactions in a block
 * accounts
   and many other things

Here we are displaying the following information using APIs: 
* Block Number
* Gas Used
* Transaction Count 
* Transactions
